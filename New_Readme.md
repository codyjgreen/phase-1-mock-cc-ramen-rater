To rewrite the `README.md` file for the "Ramen Rater" mock code challenge, I will incorporate instructions that emphasize the importance of using specific function names to pass the tests. This modification will guide students to name their functions in a way that aligns with the provided test suite, ensuring their code can be accurately evaluated.

Here's a revised version of the `README.md` content:

# Phase 1 Mock Code Challenge: Ramen Rater

## Learning Goals

- Access information from an API using a GET request and use it to update the DOM.
- Listen for user events and update the DOM in response.

## Introduction

In this challenge, you'll be building an app for rating ramen. You will use a local API and develop the frontend for our app.

**Important:** To pass the automated tests, your solution must use specific function names as outlined below. This ensures that your code can be properly evaluated by our testing tools.

## Required Function Names

Your code must include the following function names:
1. `displayRamens`
2. `addSubmitListener`
3. `renderOneRamen`
4. `showRamenDetails`
5. `addNewRamen`
6. `deleteRamen`

These functions are essential for the test suite to verify your code. Ensure that these functions are correctly implemented and exported if you are using modules.

## Task Description

Your app should allow users to view, add, and delete ramen ratings. Here's a breakdown of the functionality expected:

- **Display Ramens:** Implement the `displayRamens` function to fetch and display ramen data.
- **Add Ramen Ratings:** Use the `addSubmitListener` function to handle the submission of new ramen ratings.
- **Render a Ramen:** The `renderOneRamen` function should take a ramen object and add it to the DOM.
- **Show Ramen Details:** Implement `showRamenDetails` to display detailed information about a selected ramen.
- **Add New Ramen:** Use `addNewRamen` to add a new ramen rating to the database.
- **Delete Ramen:** The `deleteRamen` function should remove a ramen rating.

Ensure each function adheres to its respective purpose as described.

## Demo

Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

## Setup

- Run `json-server --watch db.json` to get the backend started
- Open the `index.html` file on your browser
- Write your code in the `index.js` file
- As you are writing your code out and completing the deliverables ensure that it works on the DOM and passes the tests by running `mocha` in a new terminal in the same directory

## Endpoints

Your base URL for your API will be: `http://localhost:3000`

The endpoints you may need are:

- GET `/ramens`
- GET `/ramens/:id`

Feel free to add any additional classes or ids to any elements in the HTML file
as you see fit.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

- See all ramen images in the `div` with the id of `ramen-menu`. When the page
  loads, request the data from the server to get all the ramen objects. Then,
  display the image for each of the ramen using an `img` tag inside the
  `#ramen-menu` div.
- Click on an image from the `#ramen-menu` div and see all the info about that
  ramen displayed inside the `#ramen-detail` div and where it says
  `insert comment here` and `insert rating here`.
- Create a new ramen after submitting the `new-ramen` form. The new ramen should
  be added to the`#ramen-menu` div. The new ramen does not need to persist; in
  other words, if you refresh the page, it's okay that the new ramen is no
  longer on the page.

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure
> to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I can:

- See the details for the first ramen as soon as the page loads (without
  clicking on an image)
- Update the rating and comment for a ramen by submitting a form. Changes should
  be reflected on the frontend. No need to persist. You can add this HTML to the
  `index.html` file to create the edit form:

```html
<form id="edit-ramen">
  <h4>Update the Featured Ramen</h4>
  <label for="rating">Rating: </label>
  <input type="number" name="rating" id="new-rating" />
  <label for="new-comment">Comment: </label>
  <textarea name="new-comment" id="new-comment"></textarea>
  <input type="submit" value="Update" />
</form>
```

- Delete a ramen (you can add a "delete" button if you'd like, or use an
  existing element to handle the delete action). The ramen should be removed
  from the `ramen-menu` div, and should not be displayed in the `ramen-detail`
  div. No need to persist.

## Extra Advanced Deliverables

You'll need these endpoints for the advanced deliverables:

- POST `/ramens`
- DELETE `/ramens/:id`
- PATCH `/ramens/:id`

As a user, I can:

- persist my updates to a ramen's rating and comment. (PATCH request)
- persist new ramens that I create (POST request)
- persist any ramen deletions (DELETE request)

## Testing

Your submission will be tested automatically for functionality and adherence to the naming conventions. Make sure to test your application thoroughly and ensure that all functions are named and implemented as specified.
